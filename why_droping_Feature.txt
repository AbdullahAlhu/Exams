in determining wither the bus is  Breakdown or Running Late i use some feature that help me so i will drop: 

 School_Year > it will not affect the directly the condition of the target.

Busbreakdown_ID> Id will not be helpful because it is unique.

Occurred_On &Created_On> because the the bus will not Occurred if it Breakdown or Running Late.


Number_Of_Students_On_The_Bus> it will not make any different in the condition of the bus 



Incident_Number> consider as an id 


Unique in Informed_On

Unique in Last_Updated_On
